# CSCI-230-Portfolio-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was looking for a consultant to assist in the Creation of a game. The game needed to be able to run on multiple platforms and pull data from a webserver to connect players. The game needed to have an intuitive and easy to use AI while also being fast and responsive for the players. The game would need to hold up to 200 high quality images, and render them over a set period of time. The Gaming Room wanted advice on the best OS sructure to use in their game as well as file transfer structure for rapidly sending data.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think my rationale for the design requirements was good. I tried to do as much research as possible into The Gaming Rooms problem and the capabilities they would need to accomplish their goal. It was interesting to read about computing structures and strategies that have been developed and refined over the years.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I thought it was easy to visualize how the system should process information based off the design document. The program driver and its processes interact to create an experience that the user should enjoy. The design document made it easy to setup the outline for the process and would definitly cut down on planning time later down the line when the product is closer to release.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would want to improve my rationale on server and memory management. While The Gaming Room may be a fictional company, i think these areas are important when it comes to areas like cloud computing. The less data a company uses, the less money they have to pay for it, so keeping data limits to a minimum with high level memory managment could server to save the company money and processing power.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It's important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones using the product. if the user has a bad time using the product, they will noo longer want to use it. I think The Gaming Room had a good idea to put focus on their operating structure, but in a world where flashy lights and convinving signs can get anyones attention, i think they would benfit more from having a smooth UI and exnjoyable user experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I tried to approach designing this software with longevity and scope in mind. If The Gaming Room's app becomes extremely popular and they dont have the server capacity for the demand, they will lose out on profits and the user experience will also be impacted. In the future, I would like to analyze a companies projected user base and frowth rate, so approximate data needs can be evaluated.
